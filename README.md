# Advanced-3D-Wavetable-Synthesizer
 3D Wavetable synthesizer made with JUCE & VST3

Features:
 - 3D Wavetable Engine
 - Wavetable Frame Visualized via Screen
 - Wavetable morphing
 - Oversampling by factor of 2 to remove artifacts due to anti-aliasing
 
 - Phase shifting
 - Randomized phase shifts
 - Up to 16-voices playing at once
 - Real-time Pitch Shift
 - Real-time detune
 - Real-time panning
 - Real-time volume change


Skills Learned/Knowledge acquired after building this project:
- DSP Theory
- Upsampling, Oversampling, Downsampling
- Lagrange Interpolation
- Nyquist Frequency
- Filters
- Fast Fourier Transforms
- Logic Gates, Assembly Programming language...(after learning about pointers in C++, I wanted to get a intuitive understanding of it. So ended up learning all the way from transistors up using first principles)
- Component based UI Design
- C++ STL Algorithms
- ...
